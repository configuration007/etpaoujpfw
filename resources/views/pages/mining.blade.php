                            Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoin by solving puzzles. It consists of
                            computing
                            systems equipped with specialized chips competing to solve mathematical puzzles. The first
                            bitcoin
                            miner (as these systems are called) to solve the puzzle is rewarded with bitcoin. The mining
                            process
                            also confirms transactions on the cryptocurrency's network and makes them trustworthy.

                            For a short time after Bitcoin was launched, it was mined on desktop computers with regular
                            central
                            processing units (CPUs). But the process was extremely slow. Now the cryptocurrency is generated
                            using large mining pools spread across many geographies. Bitcoin miners aggregate mining systems
                            that consume massive amounts of electricity to mine the cryptocurrency.

                            At the heart of bitcoin mining is a math puzzle that miners are supposed to solve in order to
                            earn bitcoin rewards. The puzzle is called proof of work (PoW), a reference to the computational
                            work expended by miners to mine bitcoin. Though it is often referred to as complex, the mining
                            puzzle is actually fairly simple and can be described as guesswork.
                        </p>
                        <p class="gqCDjH">
                            The miners in Bitcoin's network try to come up with a 64-digit hexadecimal number, called a
                            hash, that is less than or equal to a target hash in SHA256, Bitcoin's PoW algorithm.
                        </p>
                        <p class="gqCDjH">
                            A miner's
                            systems use considerable brute force in the form of multiple processing units stacked together
                            and spit out hashes at different rates—megahashes per second (MH/s), gigahashes per second
                            (GH/s), or terahashes per second (TH/s)—depending on the unit, guessing all possible 64-digit
                            combinations until they arrive at a solution. The systems that guess a number less than or equal
                            to the hash are rewarded with bitcoin.
